Course Description
Most real-world phenomena include non-deterministic or non-deterministically predictable
features. The course is designed to provide an introduction to the mathematical treatment
of such aspects, acquainting the students with both probability and statistics. The course
includes: mathematical definition of probability; combinatorics; finite, discrete and
continuous probabilities of single and joint random variables; law of large numbers and
normal approximation; sampling; estimation; testing of hypotheses; correlation and
regression.
Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and Links to Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs)
Teaching and Learning Methodologies
● The course tries to serve several complementary needs.
1. It is a basic introduction, but with some more advanced topics.
2. The emphasis is on solving exercises, but with some attention to the deductive
structure of the theory with the related proofs.
3. It develops the basic elements of statistics, but with their probabilistic
background.
● The class meets for lectures twice a week and for recitations once a week. You are
expected to study outside of class, up to four hours for each day of class. Studying
can be reading the book, reviewing notes, practicing problems, or doing homework.
● Homework is assigned every week, using the WebAssign platform, and needs to be
completed by the first class of the following week.
Upon successful completion of this
course the student will be able to:
