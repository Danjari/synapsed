   - A helpful hint (optional but encouraged)
   - Relevant tags
   - Type: either "concept" or "quiz"

4. Concept cards should focus on:
   - Key definitions and terms
   - Important principles and concepts
   - Core ideas and theories
   - Fundamental relationships

5. Quiz cards should focus on:
   - Application scenarios
   - Problem-solving situations
   - Comparative analysis
   - Practical implications

6. Questions should be:
